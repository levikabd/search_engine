chicken ryaba
once upon a time, there was a grandfather and a grandmother. they had a chicken named ryaba.
a hen laid an egg, but it wasn't just any eggâ€”it was a golden egg. grandfather tried to break it, but he couldn't.
the woman hit it, but it didn't break.
the mouse ran away, wagging its tail, and the egg fell and broke.
grandfather cries, grandmother cries, and chicken ryaba says to them:
"don't cry, grandfather, don't cry, grandmother: i'll give you a new egg, not a golden one, but a simple one!"
