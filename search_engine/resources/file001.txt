Russian folk tales
Fairy tales were written not only in Russia, but all over the world, in order to tell children about the dangers of the adult world in a way that they could understand (think of the famous "Little Red Riding Hood"), to teach them to be friends and express their love, to remain true to their beliefs, and to do good and brave things. Each nation chose the stories that their children encountered, but fairy tales also contain universal values, as we are all united in our core beliefs. We have compiled a collection of Russian folk tales that can be read to children before bedtime. Russian folk tales are the best family reading for children and adults. Kolobok, Masha and the Bear, mermaids, and heroes come to life on the pages of our favorite tales that we remember from childhood. Folk tales played the same role in the past as media does for us now, so they are not only interesting and educational, but can also serve as a small glimpse into our history. All of our favorite Russian folk tales are included in this collection.
