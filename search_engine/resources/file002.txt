the wolf and the seven little goats
there was a goat and her kids. the goat would go to the forest to eat silk grass and drink cold water. as soon as she left, the kids would lock the house and stay inside. when the goat returned, she would knock on the door and sing: "my little kids, open the door!" your mother has come, and she has brought milk; the milk runs down her teat, from her teat to her hoof, from her hoof to the ground! the little goats will open the door and let their mother in. she will feed and water them, and then go back to the forest, and the little goats will lock themselves in.
the wolf overheard the goat singing. once the goat was gone, the wolf ran to the hut and shouted in a thick voice: "you little children! you little goats! open the door, open the door, your mother is here, she has brought you milk. her hooves are full of water!"
the kids answer him: "we hear, we hear — but it's not my mother's voice! our mother sings in a thin voice and doesn't wail like that. the wolf has nothing to do. so he went to the blacksmith shop and had his throat reforged so that he could sing in a thin voice. the blacksmith reforged his throat. the wolf ran back to the hut and hid behind a bush.
here comes the goat and knocks: "goatlets, little ones! open up, open up! your mother has come, she has brought milk; the milk runs down her teat, from her teat to her hoof, from her hoof to the ground!" the goatlets let their mother in and told her how the wolf had come to eat them.
the goat fed and watered the kids, and gave them strict instructions: "if anyone comes to the hut and asks in a deep voice, don't open the door or let anyone in. as soon as the goat left, the wolf returned to the hut, knocked on the door, and started whining in a high-pitched voice: "little kids, open the door! open the door, little kids!" your mother came and brought milk; the milk ran down her teat, from her teat to her hoof, from her hoof to the ground! the kids opened the door, and the wolf jumped in and ate all the kids. only one kid hid in the oven.

a goat comes; no matter how she called or lamented, no one answered her. she saw the door open, ran into the hut, and found no one there. she looked in the oven and found a single kid.
when the goat found out about her misfortune, she sat down on a bench and began to grieve and cry bitterly: "oh, my little kids, my little goats! why did you open and close the doors, why did you let the evil wolf in?"
the wolf heard this, went into the hut, and said to the goat: "why are you blaming me, my dear? i didn't eat your kids. stop crying, let's go for a walk in the forest." they went into the forest, and there was a pit with a fire in it. the goat said to the wolf, "let's see who can jump over the pit."
they began to jump. the goat jumped over, and the wolf jumped and fell into a hot pit. his belly burst open from the fire, and the kids jumped out, all alive, and jumped back to their mother. and they all went on living together.
